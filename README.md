```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BwithE/shELK/main/ello-stack.sh```

**_Make the script executable:_**

```sudo chmod +x ello-stack.sh```

**_Then run the script:_**

```sudo ./rello-stack.sh``` **_or_** ```sudo bash ello-stack.sh```

**_Next, we can go to ```127.0.0.1:5601``` to see Kibana._**
